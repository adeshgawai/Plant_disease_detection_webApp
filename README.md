Plant disease detection webapp functioning:
Data Collection: You collected a diverse dataset of plant images, including samples of both healthy plants and those affected by various diseases. Each image was carefully labeled with the corresponding disease type or marked as healthy.

Preprocessing: Before training the model, you likely preprocessed the images to standardize their size, color, and orientation. This step ensures consistency and optimizes the training process.

Model Training: Using machine learning techniques, you trained a neural network model on the preprocessed dataset. The model learned to recognize patterns and features in the images that corresponded to different types of plant diseases.

Validation: Throughout the training process, you validated the model's performance using a separate subset of the dataset not seen during training. This step helped assess the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Model Deployment: Once the model achieved satisfactory performance, you deployed it into a user-friendly interface, such as a mobile app or web platform. This interface allowed users, particularly farmers, to interact with the model easily.

User Interaction: Users could upload images of their plants through the interface, either directly from their devices or by taking a photo using the app. The uploaded images were then processed by the model.

Disease Detection: The model analyzed the uploaded images and identified any visible symptoms of plant diseases. It then provided a diagnosis or classification, indicating the presence of specific diseases or confirming the plant's health status.

Output and Recommendations: Finally, the diagnosis or classification results were presented to the user through the interface. Along with the diagnosis, the system might have provided additional information, such as recommended treatments or management practices for the detected diseases.

Feedback Loop: Users' interactions and feedback, as well as ongoing validation and refinement processes, likely fed back into the system to continuously improve its accuracy and effectiveness over time.
